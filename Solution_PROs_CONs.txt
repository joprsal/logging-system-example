PROS
1. it works
2. log4j2 Appender implementation can be combined with plenty of available features like
   - filters
   - patterns
   - adapters
   - synchronous vs. asynchronous logging
   - etc. 

CONS
1. very simple
   - more advanced implementations already exist ("FileAppender")
   - many aspects are hard coded
   - doesn't support max file size limit / file rolling
2. requires exclusive file access
